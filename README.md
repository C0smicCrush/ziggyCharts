# ziggyCharts

Ziggy Charts exists to replace the discontinued Google Search interactive charting feature. I prefer charting to the AI modals that are currently automatically enabled (which you can disable with the -ai flag). 

Initial Thoughts: 
Simple Chrome Extension, can be activated with --chart flag at the end of queries. 
Will start with individual charts, multiple will come later. 

Data source is the data commons. By definition though, being distributed through the source of users that individually use it should prevent any blocking. 

Haven't done opensource before (i keep my tools private :>) so this is gonna be fun
